# CryptoNode

A decentralized bandwidth sharing and cryptocurrency management system designed for microcontrollers. Users can share their bandwidth in exchange for cryptocurrency rewards and manage their crypto wallets through a Bluetooth-enabled mobile app interface.

## Features

- **Cryptocurrency Management**
  - Multiple cryptocurrency support
  - Secure wallet creation and management
  - Transaction handling
  - Real-time balance checking
  - Transaction history tracking

- **Bandwidth Sharing**
  - Automated bandwidth monitoring
  - Reward distribution based on contribution
  - Configurable sharing parameters
  - Real-time metrics tracking

- **Bluetooth Connectivity**
  - Secure BLE communication
  - Mobile app pairing
  - Real-time data synchronization
  - Event-driven architecture

- **Security**
  - AES-256 encryption for data at rest
  - Secure key storage
  - Transaction signing
  - Anti-tampering measures

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75 or later
- Cargo package manager
- Compatible microcontroller (specifications TBD)
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support
- Mobile device for app interface

## Installation

1. Install Rust and Cargo:
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cryptonode.git
   cd cryptonode
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Configuration

The application can be configured through the `config.json` file, which is automatically created in the system's configuration directory. Key configuration options include:

- Bluetooth settings
- Bandwidth sharing parameters
- Reward rates
- Security settings
- Update preferences

## Usage

1. Start the CryptoNode service:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```

2. Connect your mobile device using the companion app (coming soon)

3. Configure your bandwidth sharing preferences

4. Monitor your rewards and manage your crypto wallets

### Building for Microcontroller

(Instructions for building and flashing to specific microcontroller hardware will be added once hardware specifications are finalized)

### Running Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- Private keys never leave the device
- Bluetooth communications are encrypted
- Regular security audits are recommended
- Keep firmware up to date
